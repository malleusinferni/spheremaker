# Spheremaker

I threw this together for some reason. It makes a sphere and does some stuff to it with a fragment shader loosely based on Blender's Musgrave texture. You can control the shader parameters with A/Z, S/X, D/C, F/V, and G/B. Press space to dump the current values of the shader parameters.

This is a toy rather than a useful project. It works on my machine. I make no other promises.
